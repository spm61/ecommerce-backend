  ## Description:
  This application demostrates a simple ECommerce Backend application using Sequlize databases.

  ## Installation:
  Make sure that node and MySql are installed on your machine.  Then, use MySql on schema.sql to create the database, and then use node seeds/index.js to seed the database.  Next, use npm i to get the packages installed and then use npm start to start the server.  This will cause the server to run on a local port, which is localhost:3001 by default.

  ## Usage:
  To use the project, use a program like Insomina to send Get, Post, Put, and Delete requests to the application using the API.  Use api/categories to work with categories, api/products to work with products and api/tags to work with tags. Use a number if you wish to target a specific id, like categories/1.  The included gifs demonstrate example requests.
